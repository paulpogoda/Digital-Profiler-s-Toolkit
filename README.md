# Digital Profiler's Toolkit
![profiling](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e653f605-121a-4825-b5c8-37b3251f1226)

### This toolkit, useful for profiling, research, and digital investigations, was built for me and my trainees (profilers, researchers and journalists). It contains only working and necessary tools. All are tested in real cases and are mostly free. The UI and CLI tools are separated.
### For additional purposes use [Bellingcat’s Online Open Source Investigation Toolkit](https://bellingcat.gitbook.io/toolkit).
### Do you want to have a piece of training with me? Feel free to send a request on my [LinkedIn Service Page](https://www.linkedin.com/services/page/62913232ba4bb59a24/) in Russian or English.

## Research
### UI
- [Open Measures](https://public.openmeasures.io/timeline?searchTerm=qanon&startDate=2023-12-11&endDate=2024-06-10&websites=gab&numberOf=10&interval=day&changepoint=false&esquery=content&hostRegex=true). Ex-SMAT. Research in the list of sources.
- [TGStat](https://tgstat.com/). From $20 monthly. Limited free options
- [Perplexity]()

### CLI
- [SMAT](https://gitlab.com/openmeasures/smat-cli). Provides command line tools for getting data from the Social Media Analysis Toolkit (SMAT) as well as a library for interacting with SMAT from your own code.

### GitLists
- [OSINT Custom Search Engines](https://github.com/paulpogoda/OSINT-CSE)

## OSINT Design

### Some Thoughts About Making a Profile
It's best to start with one "don't." Don't create a profile "just because I can." Firstly, it's not always ethical, and secondly, it can lead you down the wrong path.
A good rule I've developed for myself, and which I try to follow, is this: I don't need more data than I actually require to solve a specific task.

A profile is always built around a specific task. When you're investigating a crime, searching for a missing person, or when you need to hire people whose views align with the company's mission, you will naturally include creating a psychological profile. But when your task is to determine if certain provided data is fraudulent, no psychology will likely be needed. Nor will linguistic analysis.

Choose your tools according to the task. Remember, not all tasks can be solved quickly, easily, or cheaply. There are tasks you won't be able to solve. Learn from others; profiling is a constant learning process.

### OPSEC
Before you start, you have to think about operation security. It is not only about your security but also about all the people you work with and accidentally disclosing your target information without your permission. The main task is not to install tons of software on your machine but to change your behavior from insecure to secure. 

Here's the [link](https://provereno.media/blog/library/pavel-bannikov-osnovy-personalnoj-kiberbezopasnosti/) to my webinar on Personal Cybersecurity Basics (in Russian). Otherwise see [Aidan Rainey's webinar](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gIU7w_qmU1TdYD-41l4gcBjZlVCNTEVv/view) (in English). Better see both, they're different.
